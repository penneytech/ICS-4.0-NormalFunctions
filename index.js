/*

In this excercise you will make a simple function that increases the numerical value of a variable, 'counter'. 

1) Declare a variable called "counter", and set it's initial value to zero.
2) Create a function called "countUp".
3) Inside the "countUp" function, increment the 'counter' variable, and then log it's value to the console. If unsure how, google "How to increment number javascript".
4) Call the function 5 times to make the count increase by 5.
